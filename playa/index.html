<p>You don't have to have an idea to join us. We're a social group who tries to help each other make our ideas happen. You can be any age, ethnicity, and identify as any gender, you just have to be willing to contribute constructively.</p>
<p> New to <a href="https://osm.org/go/YVkTZiNM"> Playa del Carmen </a> ? We're a great place to meet fellow creative and innovative folks. </p>

<p>
We mostly use Kris' <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/D4ccOieaReN1a3v21u52iX"> Curious and Creative Whatsapp group </a>, and the <a href="https://lu.ma/playadelcarmen"> lu.ma Playa del Carmen events calendar</a>, to announce events. 
</p>
<p> When you're at the next meeting, be sure to ask to be added to the members Slack/chat group. </p>
