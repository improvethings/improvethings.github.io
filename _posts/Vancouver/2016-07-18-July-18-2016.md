“Lots of people on the internet with free time”

the scale is so huge and so many subjects it can’t run effectively or efficiently

Negar: 
Nothing reports water usage
How much energy is used to pull water up from a well
farmers pay an annual licence fee, but you don’t have to report if you change crops 
ground water uses can use as much as they want
[Front Counter BC](http://www.frontcounterbc.gov.bc.ca)
farmers use their water cap so they don’t get a smaller limit next year
Herb Lainchbury did [Waterly](http://www.waterly.ca)
survey each farmer - what if your neighbours are using too much water?
Farmers usually want government out of their hair

John: 
Food banks don't do what they’re mandating to do
Their donations are junk food
produce is very limited
[Soylent](http://www.soylent.com)
Volunteers take the good food (who often have an income — not the people who need it the most)
There’s only a surplus at Christmas and Thanksgiving, usually a shortage and often no produce at all
[DIY Solent](https://diy.soylent.com)
defective stickers often on products (on EVERY bathroom product they get)
[Reddit’s DIY community](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/wiki/diy)
0 oversight in any food bank on what they get
Food banks take the government money for salaries, volunteers do the actual work
