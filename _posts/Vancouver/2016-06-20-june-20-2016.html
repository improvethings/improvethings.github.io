<p>Chair: Kris</p>
<p>Minutes: Stephen</p>
<p>Attendees:</p>
<p>Ben - Coitr idea (discussed previous meeting)<br />
Michael - from Barcelona, interested in the startup scene<br />
Kwan - cannabis online marketplace and distributor<br />
Stephen - backpack extender idea<br />
Clayton - look at a bunch of technology from a while ago, to see if they are interesting from the point of view of lightweight smart contracts (<a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Etherium</a>)<br />
Kris - making <a href="http://www.awesomeshitclub.com/">awesome shit club</a> a TV show</p>
<p>Ideas Discussion<br />
-----------------</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coitr.wtf/">Coitr</a> Idea:</p>
<p>Ben - update on Coitr - summary: using monitors on the smartphone and a wearable device to monitor events in the bedroom to allow for improvement and entertainment<br />
-data to be encrypted<br />
-integrated with other commercial devices (Fitbit)<br />
Michael - any sexualized content can be difficult to get onto the Apple and Google Play, but particularly Apple<br />
Ben - intends to market it as a more serious medical, self knowledge and self improvment perspective<br />
Michael - younger clientel will have less<br />
Ben - maybe the shady side of the business would be interested<br />
Kris - marketing it with a 'Netflix and Chill' vibe might be a good way to keep it under the 'Disney' family friendly aspects of Apple (and Google Play to a lesser degree)<br />
Ben - I'm interested in an IOS developer<br />
Clayton - trust in the data and encrypting it, preventing de-anonymization of the data will be a key part of making the app legit<br />
Ben - maybe giving away the app and selling the anonymized data will be the way to go<br />
Michael - like Kris mentioned, anticipating the difficulty of scaling the company without drawing negative attention from Apple and Google<br />
Kris - MvP is social proof of tweeting results<br />
Ben - maybe rebranding the app is an interesting idea</p>
<p>Kwan - online marketplace for cannabis<br />
-<a href="https://highgradeaid.com/">highgradeaid.com</a><br />
Kwan - there are no good Canadian sites with good pictures, good content<br />
- most companies in Canada are focusing on their local area<br />
- true online companies at the moment, have been selling only what they are growing, so approximately five products<br />
Ben - family member is interested in growing in Ontario<br />
Kwan - applications are difficult at the moment so the best bet is to team up with existing supplier<br />
- would like to explore marketing opportunities with new markets and new technologies<br />
Kris - looking at the website, it would be interesting to be able to see more data like strength and THC vs. CBD<br />
Clayton - use bitcoin as an initial solution<br />
Kwan - targetted clients will struggle with bitcoin<br />
Stephen - incent them to use bitcoin by giving away product if they register their bitcoin account<br />
Kris - there is a company <a href="https://bitpay.com/">Bitpay</a> that does both bitcoin as well as credit cards, they might be interested<br />
Clayton - B2B might be an interesting way to sidestep much of the legal risk.<br />
Kwan - currently my customers are the end clients, and local, but people who are not local to cities with dispensaries are screwed. I want to address that market. Very often these remote people are older people, again bitcoin might be difficult for this target market.<br />
Clayton - find other ways to distribute money - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala">Hawala</a> is an example of a side-network to the existing financial network</p>
<p>Stephen's Idea<br />
Backpack Extender<br />
Standard student and city workers have small comfortable backpacks that are uncomfortable to wear for longer stints with heavier weights.<br />
A backpack extender would be a frame that would clasp around the waist and clamp a standard backpack to that would allow the weight of the backpack to be carried on the waist instead of the shoulders.<br />
Michael - it's already been done:<br />
<a href="http://www.ventragear.com/shop/mainframe">Ventra Mainframe</a><br />
<a href="http://www.vertepac.com/">Vertepac</a></p>
<p>Clayton - <a href="http://ca.norton.com/spear-phishing-scam-not-sport/article">Spear Fishing</a> explanation - getting to know your target for a specifically targeted phishing expedition.</p>
<p>Clayton idea - moving older tech to a new etherium platform</p>
<p>duplicate commercial media - store it on a distributed encrypted network. Incentivize people to store it and allow access to it, and provide content with a Tor incentivizing protocol (they exist).</p>
<p>anonymous contributor: <a href="https://put.io/">put.io</a> allows direct download from a torrent-friendly server for 3.99 a month.</p>
<p>Kris "I have never downloaded anything ever."</p>
<p>Kris Ideas - <a href="http://www.awesomeshitclub.com/">awesome shit club</a><br />
Awesome Shit Club - $50 contributions, people pitching business ideas and potentially winning the whole pot.<br />
Liberal Guilt Award - a side award invented on the spot at an event to provide a second place.<br />
Kris would like to create a TV or Youtube show.<br />
<a href="http://original.livestream.com/awesomeshitclub">livestream.com/awesomeshitclub</a> has old episodes (we think)</p>
<p>Kwan - maybe a show reviewing cannabis would work<br />
<a href="http://www.uvic.ca/research/centres/carbc/">Carbc</a> - drug and alcohol research information and informatics</p>
