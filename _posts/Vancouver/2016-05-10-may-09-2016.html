<p><strong>Ideas meeting: May 9<sup>th</sup>, 2016</strong></p>
<p><strong>Present: </strong>Ariel, Edward, Paul, Corin, Kris, Jason, Stephen, Wes, Guven, Cimarron, Sebastian<br />
<strong>Chair:</strong> Luke<br />
<strong>Minutes:</strong> Sandra</p>
<p><strong>1) Ariel:  Kidney failure prevention</strong><br />
Challenge: early stage detection<br />
Idea: device/test/ways to detect protein levels in urine that hint at kidney problems and allow people to react early enough to prevent lasting damage</p>
<p><strong>Ariel:</strong> Kidney problems are often diet related (sodium); Taiwanese have a high propensity to kidney problems (diet related)<br />
<strong>Corin:</strong> suggest tracking diet (taking pictures of food and submitting them via an app) and getting feedback<br />
<strong>Arielle:</strong> suggests submitting pictures of urine colour<br />
<strong>Paul:</strong> suggests that it doesn’t necessarily have to be an app, but could be as simple as handing out a card with a colour spectrum for people to compare their urine to<br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> raises the question, if it is feasible to create a test that’s cheap enough to be accessible for the general public and how to go about educating the general public/raising awareness; Luke suggests that Ariel should talk to a nephrologist friend of his (Emily F. at open science network)<br />
<strong>Corin:</strong> suggests a type of litmus test that can be thrown into the toilet<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> mentions that there is a dipstick test and suggests that it would be great to put more different tests into one dipstick to get more bang for your buck<br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> suggests doing a feasibility study<br />
<strong>Corin:</strong> mentions that kidney issues could also show in the face (skin color) and suggests  that there could be an app that analyses your face<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> mentions that facebook already scans pictures for signs of depression<br />
<strong>Edward:</strong> mentions that we should look at it like a doctor would – input more data, urine test, images, diet – in the background could be a doctor to analyse the data<br />
<strong>Corin:</strong> suggest to create awareness by creating  easy to remember slogans<br />
<strong>Wes:</strong> mentions that blood is more accurate than urine<br />
<strong>Sebastian:</strong> suggests that there should be an add-on for a phone to measure blood<br />
<strong>Cimarron:</strong> suggests installing testing mechanisms in urinals<br />
<strong>Luke</strong>: mentions a  sensor in a urinal for the detection of creatinine<br />
<strong>Cimarron:</strong> idea to put it in a public urinal is problematic because of privacy (employers, insurances etc. are interested in learning about your health)<br />
<strong>Corin:</strong> suggests to measure it further “downstream” to detect broader tendencies in a neighbourhood without identifiying individuals.<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> <a href="https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/urine-protein/tab/test/">https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/urine-protein/tab/test/</a></p>
<p><strong>2) Guven:</strong> <strong>Customisable product platform (Krakle)</strong><br />
Challenge: How to break into the local market<br />
Idea: A platform that allows small businesses to offer customisation of their products, e.g. cake shops, insurance companies, wedding planners<br />
Status: the platform is supposed to launch in 2 weeks; it was developed and tested in Turkey with positive results, but Guven finds it difficult to get traction/interest in Vancouver</p>
<p><strong>Corin:</strong> suggests to find two or three digital agencies (companies that build websites for other companies) to start using Krakle and cascade from there<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> mentions that it’s important to define the value for digital agencies<br />
<strong>Paul:</strong> suggests to have a look at Mobify<br />
<strong>Corin:</strong> has a contact for Guven and offers to talk after the meeting<br />
<strong>Edward:</strong>  talks about customisation options for websites, which are easy to build – asks what is the value of Guven’s solution?<br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> mentions that Guven needs to find businesses that are struggling with the problem that he’s offering a solution for; people don’t want to learn something new, it needs to make their lives easier<br />
<strong>Guven:</strong> mentions that this is directed to amateur/small business owners (cake makers, wedding planners, etc.)<br />
<strong>Edward:</strong> suggests that the problem needs to be complex enough to make Guven’s solution necessary<br />
<strong>Corin:</strong> says that there are plenty of agencies/sites (eg. Rocket) that already offer this - and more - as part of their service<br />
<strong>Kris</strong>: asks about the positioning, differentiation from other solutions --&gt; Guven says that with his solution you can change/adapt your workflow easily, whereas other solutions don’t allow that (or only against a high price)<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> asks if it works with Wordpress --&gt; not yet; Kris mentions that a client of his (flower arrangement for head stones - <a href="http://www.flowerhalo.com/">Flower Halo</a>) may be a potential user, but they are not technical and they wouldn’t want to learn something new – so it would have to be compatible with Wordpress (and other similar platforms)<br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> suggests that it needs to be super easy for non-technical people; it needs to be an end-to-end solution that doesn’t depend on the user’s technical abilities<br />
<strong>Guven</strong>: he made three interfaces to cater to peoples’ preferences (folder based and others)<br />
<strong>Wes:</strong> suggests to walk from door to door and explain it to small businesses<br />
<strong>Luke</strong>: suggests free support for the first 10 customers, which help refine the product<br />
<strong>Guven:</strong> thinks about giving support for free for the first customer of each category<br />
<strong>Corin:</strong> mentions that the price of the product needs to take into consideration that the support costs money/time (monthly fee)<br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> suggests not charging for the support/product, but take a part in the sales<br />
<strong>Stephen: </strong>suggests a different business model: 25$ for implementation, 10$ per hour for support; only turn it into a plug-in once the idea is proven<br />
<strong>Guven:</strong> offers different packages involving hosting<br />
<strong>Jason:</strong> suggests that people could become contributors to the service</p>
<p><strong>3) Sebastian:</strong> Tinder for vacation packages<br />
Challenge: Finding the perfect vacation package<br />
Idea: Create a Tinder-style app that allows you to swipe your way to the perfect package, including flight, accommodation, sightseeing trips; includes algorithms that help with the next suggestions; swipe left/ right for yes/no</p>
<p><strong>Kris: </strong>mentions sunwing.ca<br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> swiping helps the database learn, swiping also allows to identify matches (vendors could get feedback on popular products and create an offer based on that)<br />
<strong>Sebastian: </strong>could be a player on the sharing economy (for event accommodation, Airbnb) --&gt; Stephen says that it sounds really labour intensive<br />
<strong>Stephen:</strong> the swiping could be the unique value (swipe yes or no for all inclusive – yes/no, beach – yes/no and so on, and swipe yourself to a result)<br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> swipe yes/no on add-ons (rental car, vip bar ticket); hotels that the users swiped yes on could offer incentives to the user to win his business (Sebastian would sell the data to the hotels, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>4) Jason:</strong> Resource platform for teachers (Jason is a French and Science teacher)<br />
Challenge: All teachers need teaching materials/resources<br />
Idea: An online platform that offers resources for teachers of all disciplines all in one place, including annotations<br />
<strong><br />
Question:</strong> What need do teachers have that is not met by commonly available resources?<br />
<strong>Jason: </strong>If you want to teach you have to either inherit resources from a predecessor or create them yourself; the idea is to collect resources, have them voted on and make them available to teachers (or those who want to be teachers)<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> mentions classcentral.com (list of free online classes); mentions <a href="http://www.krisconstable.com/free-university-courses/">Free University Courses/MOOC (Aggregator of the aggregators)</a><br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> suggests an education wiki (instead of wordpress based online presence), free for teachers to use, compensate people in credit for the use of their lesson plans; reputation value for frequently used lesson plans (or number of students that were taught using this plan)<br />
<strong>Jason:</strong> Students could also access the plans by subscription<br />
<strong>Cimarron</strong>: suggests a diagnostic feature for course recommendations; mentions gamification aspect of duolingo where you can get your individual diagnostic of your linguistic weaknesses<br />
<strong>Wes:</strong> could be useful to review lesson plans<br />
<strong>Edward:</strong> mentions overlap with his idea; people could contribute to the education wiki; more interaction with the community; alternative to standard teacher / student relationship; more interactive; open source; different categories (idioms, vocabulary, conjugations, pronunciation)</p>
<p><strong>5) Edward</strong>: language efficiency app<br />
Challenge: language learning is not personalised and efficient enough<br />
Idea: an app that helps language students to make their study more personalised and efficient</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong> main challenge is memorizing words and how to apply them in real-life situations; students should be able to build up their own word lists (customised based on interests); users can input sample sentences; community can contribute examples and recordings of different pronunciations; up-voting, down-voting for good contributions/bad contributions<br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> mentions speech recognition --&gt;Edward says that he would like to integrate a recording/playback plug-in<br />
<strong>Corin</strong>: Asks what is the most important thing to solve for Edward?--&gt; increase of learning efficiencies, customised learning based on your knowledge and capabilities or circumstances<br />
<strong>Ariel</strong>: asks about target group --&gt;Edward says it’s universal<br />
<strong>Corin:</strong> suggests to make an initial test and then create training based on that<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> mentions Lucas, who’s fluent in over 30 languages, and who’s working on a tool that tries to beat Google translate on the contextual level --&gt;suggests to Edward to talk to Lucas<br />
<strong>Corin</strong>: suggests to concentrate on Chinese market for TOEFL to turn it into a business<br />
<strong>Luke</strong>: suggests cooperation between Edward and Jason--&gt; Edward focuses on the data set, Jason comes in afterwards<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> suggests for Edward and Jason to look into <a href="https://moodle.org/">https://moodle.org/</a></p>
<p><strong>6) Sandra: Raise awareness around sustainability matters</strong></p>
<p>Challenge: There are many people who may want to live more sustainably, but don’t know how, or feel discouraged thinking that they can’t make a difference<br />
Idea: Find a way to raise awareness and offer easy to implement advice on more sustainable practices in everyday live</p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> Find a way to gamify and socialize sustainability – share and compare with social network: How many bottles have you recycled this week? (social merit) --&gt;get people to submit ideas; up-vote/down-vote useful tips/practices<br />
<strong>Corin</strong>: Set up a sustainability score; calculate carbon removed from the atmosphere through sustainable practices (e.g. gas calculator)--&gt; progress could be visualised through a growing tree (compare Car2go tree); or actually plant a tree as a reward; show the scale – 1 flight vs X amount of recycled bottles? What’s the real impact of using a metal straw versus a disposable straw?; work with peer pressure (now 65% of your neighbours recycle bottles)<br />
<strong>Wes:</strong> highlights differences in recycling practices across municipalities; mentions that you can’t drop off styrofoam in Vancouver, but you can in New West --&gt; how to minimize trips to recycle depot? <strong>Ariel:</strong> mentions facebook group “Nifty”<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> mentions tipping point pricing on sustainability items – once one thing tips it’s bought<br />
<strong>Suggestion:</strong> credit card data (purchasing history) mapped to sustainability --&gt; airmiles for sustainability card; banking platform tells you how you can recycle your purchases; suitable, more eco-friendly opportunities could be promoted<br />
<strong>Suggestion</strong>: Provide information about how many and which parts of a popular product are recyclable? (i.e. iPhone)<br />
<strong>Suggestion:</strong> become an authority or a sustainability coach in the field; create an environmental working group to independently audit products<br />
<strong>Corin:</strong> Cultural shift: pick one needle mover topic (e.g. food waste); monthly topics; yearly topics<br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> we need events (booth at farmers market, meetup groups) for the people who have not yet adopted a sustainability model – offer practical steps<br />
<strong>Suggestion:</strong> Take major themes to scale (environmental impact, health)<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> suggests to offer a subscription of a monthly sustainability package ($20 subscription) in cooperation with companies like e.g. the soap dispensary<br />
à companies put sustainable products (e.g. metal straws) worth more than 40$ and the package includes a write up about the product/sustainability matters<br />
<strong>Jason:</strong> Reach teachers that raise awareness with children (sustainability package for teachers); Jason offers to cooperate with Sandra --&gt; offer workshops in schools or communities<br />
<strong>Stephen:</strong> Get sponsorship, get grants, fundraising to ensure viability; a blog lends authority</p>
<p><strong>7) Kris: How to find your top passion and master a domain in life?</strong><br />
Many people in Kris’ network are moving away from financial goals in life (comfort and luxury) and move towards a more ideal driven lifestyle.<br />
Challenge: How to find what your top passion or calling is? How to master a domain in life?</p>
<p><strong>Luke:</strong> Get up, dress up, show up<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong>  asks what do people do to find motivation/discipline?<br />
<strong>Corin:</strong> often the lack of discipline can be a pointer (why am I unmotivated?); question the goal<br />
<strong>Paul:</strong> maybe it’s a pointer that you’re not that into it, if you find it hard to discipline yourself; tries to marry hobbies/interests and work to avoid the discipline issue --&gt;you’re motivated because you love what you do<br />
<strong>Corin</strong>: Think of your live as a series of blocks and parts and fit them together rather than trade off parts against each other<br />
<strong>Paul</strong>: it’s harder to plan for the future, if you don’t follow the traditional path<br />
<strong>Cimarron:</strong> work/life should be less separated; do something good for yourself (go for a swim in the sea) first, and then do your work<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> Harvard business review – <a href="https://hbr.org/1998/11/work-and-life-the-end-of-the-zero-sum-game">work life balance is a zero sum game</a><br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> plays tricks on himself; he knows he won’t regret doing something, but will regret <u>not</u> doing something<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> mentions a headband that monitors his sleep (Zio – defunct company)<br />
--&gt; journal your sleep and then look at the data<br />
<strong>Kris:</strong> invites people to the Biofeedback lap to participate in the sensor project (add link); talks about the “watch state” that is part of the circadian rhythm<br />
--&gt; Luke has a contact for a clinical trial<br />
--&gt; Kris mentions RFID temperature sensor; with enough temperature sensors maybe you could average core temp.</p>
<p><strong>8) Kris: How to satisfy your needs (based on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs)<br />
</strong>Challenge: today we often satisfy our needs in the higher levels of the pyramid, but lack needs in the levels below (e.g. sleep, sex, adequate food, health)<br />
Idea: find a way to tackle the problem and create a sustainable way to solve it<br />
<strong>Paul: </strong>suggests Tinder for needs based on Maslow<br />
<strong>Luke:</strong> gamify, peer comparison<br />
<strong>Cimarron:</strong> app could offer solutions/recommendations depending on what’s missing (e.g. sex – recommend tinder, food – recommend food solution)</p>
<p><strong>9) Cimarron: Optimization of small scale crop fields</strong><br />
--&gt; Will present some other time</p>
<p><strong>10)Luke: contact metadata</strong><br />
Challenge: we have lots of contacts, but often not enough information to leverage them<br />
Idea: find a way to attach details about a person, which are relevant to you, to their contact information<br />
--&gt;will talk about it next week</p>
<p><strong>Next Week:</strong><br />
