<p>Ideas Discussions</p>
<p>Craigslist selling as a service<br />
-------------------------------<br />
Kris: it takes a lot of effort to create accounts, prepare product ads, deal with clients on craigslist<br />
pay someone (college student) to come, inventory and sell gear, particularly electronics<br />
minimum wage, trusworthy people?<br />
Stephen: another mechanism would be to provide a commission percentage to the sellers to incent them to sell the high value items<br />
many craigslist items specifically discourage haggling, which gives the owner a way to verify trust<br />
Scott: <a href="http://www.freegeekvancouver.org/">Free Geek Vancouver</a> - provides a service to give electronics away<br />
Kris: Some of the gear is quite geeky and rare, maybe a swap for other cool gear would be fun<br />
Wine Tasting<br />
--------------------------------<br />
Stephen: wine tasting is the best way to buy wine, what are the obstacles to arranging wine tasting where people can be sold small<br />
tastes before buying bottles or cases of the wine they like</p>
<p>Kris: LCLB - special event licenses is needed to sell wine or beer below a particularly (high price)<br />
Need to check minimum pricing, and the difference between bar licences and off-licences<br />
<a href="http://www.uvic.ca/research/centres/carbc/">CARBC</a> - produce graphics and infographics detailing alcohol / drug use in Victoria<br />
Josh Clark - sommelier on Victoria Island<br />
Alberto: Might want to find some added value- particularly to target lower end markets<br />
wine guides, music, different countries</p>
<p>Random Discussion about Social Media and Messaging, Privacy and Security<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Alberto:  uses <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">Omnifocus</a> and <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a> to modify messaging and notifications<br />
Kris: nice to isolate news feed from messaging<br />
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca&amp;hl=en">Messenger</a> is the most intrusive android app that Kris has ever seen, has the ability to turn on camera, record phone calls, etc.<br />
It's possible to use the browser to send messages without giving up control, but lose timely notifications<br />
Vanessa: Interested in email security and privacy applications<br />
Kris: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>  works well as an email addon, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)">Signal</a>  - works the best for messaging<br />
Alberto: Question about how well Tor works for messaging<br />
Kris: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> has lousy latency, so is poor for voice messaging, but works OK for text<br />
Vanessa: Is there a way to reroute telephone calls?<br />
Kris: It's hard enough that if it happens you have much worse problems than privacy<br />
Andrew: <a href="https://www.mautic.org/">Mautic</a> - marketing automation plaform - tracking who they are and what they do on a website<br />
<a href="http://www.thinkific.com/">Thinkific</a> is leaking private information<br />
<a href="https://www.intercom.io/">Intercom</a>  is a pretty benign engine, almost like a chat engine, clears cookies when they log out<br />
Vanessa: Lack of privacy may provoke a sense of empathy in the near future if everyone has secrets<br />
Andrew: Facebook collects vast amounts of information - you can target incredibly detailed FB users<br />
Alberto: People have learned how to subconciously block out ads<br />
Andrew: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin">Ublock Origin</a> is a great ad blocking addon<br />
Kris: "We all own pants." 'Steve' has developed a jean hanging product that is selling on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a></p>
<p>3D Printing Discussion<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
Luke: Does anyone have a good 3D printing source?<br />
Kris: has a good contact for 3D printing, also Staples offers 3d printing, Makerspace<br />
Luke Makerspace is surprisingly expensive for services like lasercutting and 3d printing<br />
Stephen: <a href="http://theupsstore.ca/477/">UPS on Commercial</a> offers 3D printing now</p>
<p>Community Housing / Arts Exchange<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
Vanessa: There is a beautiful living room space that the members would like to make usable and attractive</p>
<p>Alberto: Do you want to make the space a co-op space?<br />
Vanessa: Where to get furniture, how to make an attractive events space?<br />
Scott: Figure out from landlord and housemates, what are the groundrules for hosting events<br />
Andrew: Definitely charge per head - this covers costs and any other problems that the events cause<br />
Scott: Take care to enlist neighbors and the neighborhood in general to keep friction down, Use a single calendar that everyone works from to reduce conflicts</p>
