<p>At the March 7th, 2016 meeting in Vancouver we decided to launch #fivetenfriday.</p>
<p>The idea being, at 5pm on Friday you should challenge your creative self to let your creativity to flourish by dedicating just 10 minutes to it in any way you choose.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What it could be - a selfie, a picture, calligraphy, photograph, arrangement of your food, a poem, there are no limits.</span></p>
<p>You <del>can then choose to</del> absolutely must with no exception post the outcome to social media using the #fivetenfriday hashtag at 5:10pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
