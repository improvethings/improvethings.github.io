#### Challenges App
* Michael, Kris, and Riz working on it
* challenges.ideasmeetings.org will be the URL
* Michael doing a demo of front end
* Kris: There are artisans/techies who are purists in their form. There are also business minded people who can find value that customers will pay for. Ideally this is a Venn diagram, but you can start a business with only the business mind set
* Michael: You have to be willing to do things you don't want to do.
* It's not dumb, it's social intelligence
* The ability to think of other things is not an asset
* Try a 5 second pause between conversations

#### Adminstration of Ideas Meetings

* First experience/visit is very important
* Everyone should be presenting their ideas with the default thought that no one else knows what you do
* Doing is overrated - brain storming is invaluable
* "If I had been more open to approaches to doing things, I would have moved forward a lot faster" 
* How do we help each other, hold each other more accountable
* How are we tracking success? 
* What are are vs what we say we are - "Making Ideas Happen" is more the social hack nights on Sundays
* We don't work with each other
* Brainstorming group - great for getting feedback
* We loosen up ideas
* Our ideas get stuck in places, we help them get unstuck
* Different perspectives and areas 
* We're like a critical friend or peer
* As a doer you have to commit - that's not what we do
* We're like a philosophers meeting
* We're lika a think tank
* Create a framework for an ideas meeting chair
* What is success?
* Michael: It's an intellectual discussion place
* Michelle: I would like to see a monetized thing. I need intellectual stimulation
* Rizwan: I'm addicted to the intellectual stimulation
* Marcus: Success is that the ideas grow; they happen. You feed them, and they grow. With ideas meetings, there's a generousity. It's not about getting a financial piece. A wonderful generousity.
* Kris: You can't leave a meeting without your mental wheels spinning. I appreciate succesion planning, that I'm not a bottle neck for meetings to continue
* Can it contribute to others people's lives. What is the perceived value?
* All giving; the free sample. 
* You should get the MVP when you come here
* Getting clarity on what the value is of your idea 
	* This is the opposite of expanding ideas
* Don't use the term brainstorming even though that's what we're doing

#### Love
* Love should be only giving, no expectations of reciprocation
* [Lamrim Meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamrim)
* At which point do you become a doormat?
* Go to someone who wants it and appreciates it
* You should watch only for Appreciation, not Reciprication
* Acknowledgment could be manipulative or genuinely appreciative
* Always act as there is no manipulation involved
* Trust is blind, it's being naive, it's taking a chance
* Don't carry the brush of your history to new people

* Create a twitter bot that tweets our URLs

#### Chair responsibilities
* Get a social membership at Creative Coworkers for $30/year
* Pay what you can - PWYC
