# Ideas meeting - 2016 Dec 05 2016

## In attendance:

Kris, Rizwan, Steve, Luke, Tim, Cash, Tiffany

## Intros

### Kris
Wordpress is notrious for getting hacked. What if someone offered a service that sits on the shell where you embed a unique hash (upgradesite.com $7/mo) it detects every plugin on your site being used. And if some new plugin comes out, it goes and updates it.

### Riz
A career recommendation system for university students.


### Steve
I'm a product person. I let anger drive inspiration. I broke a lot of ikea furniture today. My idea today is to create modular parts for furniture. Solid wood, made in Canada. Indistructable. 

### Luke
I like dogs and Parrots. Backburner project I've been working on a long time. I want to commission to redo the soundtrack for this old videogame: International Karate

I'm making a camera rig to capture VR footage from rockets in flight. 

### Tifany
What if it there was subscription box for meals for bachelors. breakfast lunch dinner and snacks.
What if there was a massage thingie that massaged you the way you massaged it.

## General Discussion

Kris: Wordpress is the most popular CMS on the web and people now make money by hacking it now. You can literally hack million of sites at once if you paid for it.

What if there was a service that notified you whenever there was a service for free. And paid version would update your shit for you.

You can scan the whole internet for $160k with MassScan. You can use selenium or even lighter tools to do the updates. 

Tifany: I'm a lazy wordpress owner. I get notifications and don't do anything about it. As a person that does that, what matters to me is the auto-update. I also love if the system can suggesst an alternative plugin.

Kris: If I charged you $29.99, would you pay that?

Tifany: If I had 5/10 lucrative sites, I would do that. Will the plugin be updated?

Kris: Well you need two. A second plugin to update the plugin.

Tifany: If you had to install the plugin at every website that wont work. You need a master site that will populate it to all the other sites.

Kris: I think most people don't care about it. Just add the username/password and it'll set it up for you.

Luke: I think this is one of a build it and they will come. No idea how much money it would make -- How much do you think?

Kris: There's a million upsell features with Wordpress plugins until it's annoying. 

Luke: Why don't you just make it all those things with $29.99?

*All laugh* -- It's true!

Cash: Im assuming these guys don't have root access -- mostly shared servers. It sounds like a simple script that you can sell over and over again.

Kris: I don't know if Wordpress allows shell access directly.

Luke: Wordpress plugins give you the right access.

Kris: I guess it's one of those things I need to write it myself and see if it's a build it and they will come type situation. Also, backups are really annoying in wordpress -- but there's a $20/yr to use PGP (keys) to do easy backups. Make $$$ by providing business ideas.

Tifany: Two years ago, I'd buy it cuz i had a bunch of sites that I was managing for people. 

Riz: It's valuable for people who are managing other people's websites.

Steve: There's competitors?

Kris: Yes, but hoyu had to search for it -- know what to search for -- nad they're not doing it well. 

Tifany: One of the things that is a pain is that whenever a webmaster told me that they're shutting down my site cuz of malware: they never told me which date I need to go to where there was no malware. So somethign that solved that problem, it would be great.

Luke: You could use HashDB to check the plugins.

Tifany: I got emails that I got hacked but I have no idea what to look for and what to do. I need something that says "This is what you should do, step by step, like I'm a third grader"....
