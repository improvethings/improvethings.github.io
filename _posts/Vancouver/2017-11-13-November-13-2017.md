#### Ideas

* [Eastside Culture Crawl](https://culturecrawl.ca/)
* Fun dining experience
	* One-off/occasional event.  Not a restaurant.
	* Could be in an open space or a warehouse with temporary walls/pop-up tents
	* Ideal instagram dinner with artists' decorations
	* Each space curated with drinks/cocktails/tea/kombucha
	* Maybe fine dining in one, kombucha and pillows
	* Attendees bid on which space to attend, maybe using a decision-making app
	* Catered, probably, by each chef/curator
	* Maybe a pass or a sampler pack
	* Could be occasional with a single theme each time
	* Seasons passes
	* Restaurant idea: a space that changes the theme/decor regularly
		* Is there a space at Commercial and Venables that does this?
	* Food trucks as using a kitchen
	* [Brewery and the Beast](http://breweryandthebeast.com/) as an example
	* Kris' place in Victoria did a predecesor event with a cow and kegs
	* Vancouver has a food truck festival at Olympic Village
	* Could be done at a venue like 1000 Parker or the PNE Forum
	* Seasonal or regular?
	* Economy of scale for doing it regularly versus once-off
	* Attendees get Instagram rights to individual tents
	* Tent sponsors could do mockup online
	* Cost to get into venue in addition to bid for space
	* Example: monthly box of mystery
	* Idea: get [Later](later.com) to sponsor it
* Chaparone as a service
	* check in on a date, even have someone tail you
