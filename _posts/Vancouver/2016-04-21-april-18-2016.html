<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>IDEAS MEETING 18/4/2016</b></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><u><b>Chair and minutes:</b></u></span><b> </b><span lang="en-GB">Sandra</span></p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a><span lang="en-GB"><u><b>Attendees sitting in:</b></u></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>Fernando</b></span><span lang="en-GB"> – works in video games, has always been interested in food – cofounder of food awards</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>Tiffany</b></span><span lang="en-GB"> – has a couple of food start-ups (6 months – 1 year), healthy food company / alpine catering company (non-perishable survival food), didn’t bring a particular idea to discuss, just wants to make connections – interested in setting up a food innovation center (there used to be one, she believes that now would be a good time to get this started)</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>Kevin </b></span><span lang="en-GB">– works in engineering, came to check out the idea meeting</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>Dionne</b></span><span lang="en-GB"> –dental assistant, enjoys cooking, looking to start a balcony garden, didn’t bring an idea</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>Chris </b></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>Luke</b></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>Sasha</b></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>Brennan</b></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><u><b>Attendees with ideas:</b></u></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>1) Johnathan </b></span><span lang="en-GB">– studies at UBC – interested in building a price comparison tool for phones comparable to “gas buddy” – the tool could technically compare prices for any commodity, but he wants to talk specifically about food prices. One problem he identified is that grocery prices aren’t posted online, and he’s wondering, how to obtain crowd sourced price information.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Tiffany suggests doing a pilot programme to understand if price comparison for food is actually a problem that people need solved; talk to people in the neighbourhood, set up a focus group</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Clayton suggests to do it in the simplest way possible, based on the simplest user story, e.g. providing information about food that is about to go to waste and advertise where the food can be picked up, the simplest way could be allowing the user to post a photo from their camera to a twitter thought stream; figure out what is needed, which features are required</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Daniel suggested to harvest data from supermarket flyers </span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Clayton suggest a point system for people who upload photos of flyers or prices </span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Clayton asks if Johnathan wants this to be a neighbourhood service or the “ultimate food app”; idea to subscribe to certain products (set a price and be notified when it’s available for that price, or when the item is in season)</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Daniel suggest to try it out in a small neighbourhood</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Joel brings up that Johnathan needs to define a target market first; he thinks that this may be an interesting idea for restaurants</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Tiffany suggest to define priorities: only price? sustainability? quality?</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Dionne suggests filters for price, sustainability, quality etc.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Tiffany suggest that distributor prices could be compared, too (distributors have prices lists); she suggest to talk to small scale food processors association and BC food processors association</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Fernando says there are associations for independent (small) restaurants that Johnathan could talk</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Clayton suggest to talk to farm to table chefs</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Joel suggests to talk to culinary school alumnis</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>2) Grace</b></span><span lang="en-GB"> – finishing masters in e-health, undergrad in nutritional sciences, foodie  idea food security for the homeless: how to save near expired food for homeless people</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">There is an app in the US where people can share their perishable food with people, wonders if this exists in Vancouver</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Tiffany says that this exists for fruit (Vancouver fruit tree network </span></span><span lang="en-GB"></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB"> maps out fruit trees in the city and when the fruit is in season)</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Fernando mentions an organisation called ”Quest” (Powell and Nanaimo-ish) that pick up food from restaurants, supermarkets, groceries, hospitals that would normally be thrown out; they have a store on Hastings</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Clayton suggests that Johnathan’s app could be handy for that, too</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>3) Sobuh</b></span><span lang="en-GB"> – brought two ideas </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB">First idea: affordable grocery delivery service </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB">People think they get a good deal at the supermarket, which is not the case. Sobuh wants to offer an affordable grocery delivery service (an alternative to SPUD) and intends to start with bulk foods; $35 minimum for a CSA style box of in season food; $5 delivery charge; he’s got the vans and the warehouse sorted out; there’s a good price margin; he wants to start downtown and in South Van.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">How does he differentiate himself from SPUD?  price, SPUD is expensive</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Kris suggests free delivery from a certain price point</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Kris suggests other boxes, like a smoothie box, etc. </span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Beta customers wanted (a few ideas people interested  get Sobuh to keep us posted)</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Currently Sobuh only offers bulk food, but in the future also fruit, veg, juice, etc.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB">Second idea: vegetarian and vegan restaurant finder app</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB">Sobuh has a rating system in place, where people can take a picture of their food and rate it, make comments about menu</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Start out as a restaurant finder, could be extended to product recommendations later (scan barcode and get information)</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Kris suggests to include celiac/gf on the app</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Happy cow done right – rating, bookmarking function</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Sobuh will share mock-ups on slack for feedback</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>4) David </b></span><span lang="en-GB">– works with inventory at Best Buy </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB">First idea: David wants to combine fast food with pre-prepped food</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB">He likes the idea to buy prepped food to use on the day; he thinks that people who are short on time may want a home cooked meal, but don’t want to deal with the hassle of chopping; he can imagine setting up shops with veggie and protein stations and bottles with sauces, condiments for easy shopping.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Fernando suggests to set it up as a convenience store fridge in a 7/11 or similar </span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Kris suggests to try it for a few months at a grocery store near a skytrain station</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">David’s vision: Convenient location, possibly a food truck</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Catch the commuter crowd on the way home</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Chop-on-demand or pre-chopped</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Clayton suggests whitelabelling someone else’s chopped veg (i.e. supermarkets)</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Casey thinks there should be plenty of variety, David disagrees, he thinks that three proteins and a few veggies are enough (chopped tomatoes, bell peppers – typical stir fry ingredients)</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Scenario: A guy comes home tired after work, he’s hungry, tired, wants a home-cooked meal but can’t be bothered to chop, goes and buys pre-chopped veg (or non-chopped – which will be chopped on demand); he doesn’t have a particular plan; he will be asked which protein he wants, which starch, he can choose a sauce, he can choose spices (pre-combos for fish, for meat, different styles)</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Grace suggests an app where you can pre-order your chopped food and have it ready for when you get home</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Delivery services in the US: Pillow fresh, blue apron</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Differentiation from supermarkets pre-made food: possibly a drive-thru, very convenient location</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB">Second idea: convenient coffee</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB">David hates coffee line ups at coffee shops around UBC, he’s thinking about a subscription based super fast all you can drink coffee program. One thing that slows down the line up is payment  everything needs to be done beforehand online, David is thinking along the lines of a fingerprint scanner to sign up (sign up with your finger print on the phone and at the coffee shop again)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Caleb asks about the reasonable timeframe: David suggests less than half a minute</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Which locations?  Places where you have short bursts of high traffic (breaks between classes at universities, bus stations, Skytrain, lunch time near office buildings)</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Fernando suggests lockable coffee spouts for universities with NFC authentication that dispenses coffee really fast</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Daniel remarks that the fingerprint scanner on phones won’t make the fingerprint info available for the app</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Clayton says that technologically it should be quite easy to devise extra wide dispensers for fast fills “coffee hose”</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>5) Daniel</b></span><span lang="en-GB"> – web developer</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB">Idea: bugs as a sustainable source of protein, produce a consumer grade mealworm farm and educate people about sustainable protein</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Livestock as protein uses up lots of resources, ethical concerns, environmental problems </span></span><span lang="en-GB"></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB"> current system is not sustainable, especially as the appetite for meat worldwide increases. Bugs are the answer to feed the increasing protein demand. Daniel has been following the blog of a UBC industrial grade bug farming project, meal worms – 4 stage process – beetles produce eggs, eggs fall down to the next level, turn into larvae, shaking, tending… mealworms can be harvested after about a month. </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Mealworm protein flour</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Caleb: mentions Austrian incubator in the field</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Caleb: brings up cultural issues – but the idea could get a footing as a novelty thing</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Sasha brings up lifecycle – different set up for each bug, difficult to scale it or automate it; mealworm shaking needs to be done by hand, beetles eat the mealworms if you do it wrong</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Sasha brings up parasite problem with crickets</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">How to kill them humanly? Freeze?</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Mealworm poutine</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Kris offers the venue for a mealworm cook off, 10 bucks for everyone who’s interested</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Jump start it by ordering bugs online</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Who’s up for it: Daniel, Kris, Casey (deep fried, whole and disguised, blind tasting)  post the event on the slack list</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">How many meal worms to make a burger?</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Question: what stops people? Icky factor, vegetarian factor, not necessarily the love for animals, what if the social stigma was removed?</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Vij’s wife may be a good contact to talk to as she works with bugs</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>6) Joel</b></span><span lang="en-GB"> – used to be in the food industry, used to have a restaurant – he’s setting up an event in May to encourage small businesses to get together, backed by the Greater Vancouver Foodbank, Union Gospel and others, they have performers – main goal is family wellness. </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>7) Clayton</b></span><span lang="en-GB"> – idea to train somebody to cook exactly the way he likes it in a frictionless way that can be easily be reproduced from chef to chef, make it food-safe and turn it into a business.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB">Clayton tried to reduce the amount of friction to buy exactly what he wanted for the day’s meal. He signed up for Spud, but didn’t enjoy it. He signed up for Hotel catering, but didn’t like the lack of personalisation. He wants somebody to cook to his taste (set meals, right amount of sauce, etc).</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Caleb suggests to hire somebody to make a big batch and portion it (Clayton looked into culinary schools)</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Daniel knows a woman who makes large batch meals and sells them with preparation instructions  Daniel will try and get the person’s details to Clayton</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Chris knows an Indian woman, who cooks Indian food in big batches, and you can get 2 meals a day for a very reasonable price</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Chris suggests to encourage a service for culinary students to make some money on the side, and Clayton can make special requests regarding his food</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">The business aspect would be to communicate the food requirements seamlessly to the chefs</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">If it’s rolled out as a business, it would need to be done in an industrial kitchen</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Chris suggests a peer rating system</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>8) Caleb </b></span><span lang="en-GB">– friend of Luke’s , didn’t bring a specific idea to talk about, mentions start-ups that he heard of and finds cool like pre-chopped food for restaurants and people who make food plans for uninspired people</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">A discussion starts about daily calorie recording apps like my fitness pal and numi and their idiosyncratic way of inputting food; Caleb suggests that there could be a machine learning app that helps people to learn more about ingredients and recipes; as the person learns more, the app will become obsolete</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Brennan suggests that he’d like to receive information about the health benefits, nutritional values from such an app</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Fernando says that there are apps that scan the barcode and give information about the contents</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Discussion goes back to price comparison app  Clayton mentions that people want to know that the price they’re asked to pay is about right. </span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Price varies depending on season, different factors, pricing problems</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Filter bubble issue</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Question: is the additional time-cost to get to the cheaper produce worth the hassle</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>9) Kris:</b></span><span lang="en-GB"><a href="http://vanveg.info/"> Vanveg.info</a>, crowd-sourced price app</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Bootstrap app</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Currently offers filters for: Price, organic, locality, number one shop</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Challenges, you can only view the static price from the snapshot</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Looking for a developer to take this further, especially regarding user accounts</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Clayton suggests that people could input a menu on their end</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Fernando suggests looking into Ionic, which allows you to download authentication modules</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Daniel suggests working with an API endpoint</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">The domain is about to expire </span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Suggestion to maybe discuss further with Johnathan to explore synergy</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Question on how to identify the individual type of tomato, etc (using the product code is problematic as small grocers don’t use it)</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Clayton will talk more with Kris</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Discuss more on Slack</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>10) Casey</b></span><span lang="en-GB"> – makes healthy freezies</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB">Casey is frustrated about dealings with wholesalers and wishes there was some sort of open source “Siri” (mentions MyCraft?) that could deal with wholesalers for him. (Task: find me pineapples  tool deals with the wholesalers, connects with standard API, bids for food, closes the deal) </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Caleb: reference to Electronic Data Interchange, problem with adherence</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span lang="en-GB">Sobuh: distributors don’t want to have everybody to have complete knowledge about their prices, suppliers don’t want to be in a price war; also when you talk to a distributor prices will always vary depending on who you talk to</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-GB"><b>Closing notes:</b></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB">Kris: asks to take turns with minutes, chairing the meeting and social media</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-GB">It was agreed that for </span><span lang="en-GB"><b>Monday, April 25</b></span><sup><span lang="en-GB"><b>th </b></span></sup><span lang="en-GB">Clayton will chair the meeting</span><span lang="en-GB"><b>, </b></span><span lang="en-GB">Luke will take minutes<br />
