<p><strong>IDEAS MEETING June 13, 2016</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Minutes:</u></strong> Sandra</p>
<p><strong><u>Attendees:</u></strong> Luke, Stephen, Sandra, Ben, Kris</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>1) LUKE – Japanese scroll printing</u></strong></p>
<p>Luke is involved in Japanese tea ceremony, which involves old artefacts (old scrolls with brush writing on it); his teacher shows scrolls and explains the meaning (literal meaning, symbolic meaning, zen meaning).</p>
<p><strong>Idea:</strong> digital archive and online service to collect/share/discuss/print scrolls; offer information about the meaning; scan scrolls and print them on rice paper on demand; sell prints</p>
<p>Stephen: asks, if the people who are interested in scrolls would appreciate receiving a print like that</p>
<p>Luke: provenance is important; the print would be a copy of an original scan of a certain person’s work, which would be relevant</p>
<p>Luke: The site would have to be designed to be multilingual à Luke may have a contact from the tea ceremony group that would have the required language proficiency</p>
<p>Luke: has contacts (his sensei has many scrolls – 100 poems) which could be digitised</p>
<p>Sandra: suggests to approach Japanese embassy and Japanese cultural centre for funding/contacts/cooperation</p>
<p>Luke: every tea sensei around the world will have his/her own collection of scrolls</p>
<p>Stephen: sell personalised scrolls for westerners with relevant characters (e.g. to a sports person “vigor, determination…” or to companies with characters relevant to their company philosophy); get involved with charities (e.g. Trudeau could brush paint a scroll for charity)</p>
<p><strong>Ideas for names?</strong> Jiku (means scroll)</p>
<p>Sandra: maybe Luke could talk with Paul about the archiving portion of the project</p>
<p>Luke: paper quality is a challenge, depth of the ink is a challenge, mounting the scroll is a challenge</p>
<p>Stephen: print with shadow to simulate depth</p>
<p>Sandra: what would be a good platform?</p>
<p>Luke: it would have to be a content management system; third parties should be able to put content on it, but it would need to be curated; a moderator is required</p>
<p>Luke: museums have many priceless scrolls</p>
<p>Sandra: museums may have a need for archiving</p>
<p>Sandra: it would probably be very easy to build a forum for people to discuss the meaning of the scrolls; curators for third party submissions could be recruited among knowledgeable forum contributors</p>
<p>Luke: asks Ben for a state of the art forum tool that helps putting value comments at the top (upvoting) and keeps out the trolls</p>
<p>Ben: <a href="http://discourse.org">http://discourse.org</a></p>
<p>Stephen: Top 3 forum posts could be displayed in the content section</p>
<p>Luke: Filter tool to look for scrolls that relate to your interests (e.g. tea)</p>
<p>Luke:  Incentive to upload scrolls - people could sell their scrolls through the site and get a share</p>
<p>Luke: Wants to talk to Hannah Cho</p>
<p><strong>Accountability:</strong> Get some scrolls and try scanning by 13.07.2016</p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>2) BEN – e-commerce</u></strong></p>
<p>Taiga – ecommerce, allows you to run multiple stores with one account</p>
<p>An online tradeshow – you sell half yourself to consumers, the other half to other businesses</p>
<p>Upsell to register the domain</p>
<p>Open srs for DNS registration</p>
<p>$9/month or $60/year</p>
<p>Shopify is $30/month</p>
<p>Letsencrypt.org</p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>3) Stephen – gym podcast</u></strong></p>
<p>In the gym it’s difficult to do exercises right; people who are new to the gym may be tentative to try an exercise for fear of doing it wrong, people looking, judging, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Idea:</strong> develop podcasts with step-by-step guide to do different exercises (e.g. bench press), like an audio trainer for gym newbies</p>
<p>Stephen: put QR code on the machine (cooperate with community gyms)</p>
<p>Sandra: would it hurt the gym’s interest in selling personal trainer service?</p>
<p>Kris: Remove liability – don’t even mention safety, make it only a “how to”</p>
<p>Luke: it should be possible to customise the voice of the coach</p>
<p>Sandra: where would the expertise come from?</p>
<p>Stephen: agregate information from communities, forums</p>
<p>Kris: mentions “Starting strength” by Mark Rippetoe as a good reference book</p>
<p>Related to another idea: guided audio tour in museums or in cities à do they already exist in Vancouver?</p>
<p>Kris: mentions vice.com documentaries about gnarly cultural practices, drugs, weapon deals, etc.</p>
<p>Luke: knows an Estonian person who’s into weightlifting that could be a coaching voice</p>
<p>Luke: gamify the gym experience</p>
<p>Stephen: unlock voices or features for achievements</p>
<p>Luke: reach out to famous fitness youtubers etc. to do voiceovers for you</p>
<p>Ben: How do you monetize it?</p>
<p>Stephen: advertising – clickable (podcast is listened to on the phone)</p>
<p>Ben: compares with Spotify – use free with advertising or pay to get it without advertising</p>
<p>Sandra: what about video?  à not a priority, minimal viable product is just a pleasant voice/motivating voice</p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>4) BEN: sex app “KOITR”</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Idea:</strong> record performance data via apple watch</p>
<p><strong>Application:</strong> check performance data to decide when to change position (could be indicated by colour change on the apple watch); after the act, rate the partner and post it on Facebook; gamify; watch to watch interface; diary component; bio feedback between apple watch and phone (heart rate, calories, decibels); Show partner’s heart rate on the watch, also when not engaged</p>
<p>Kris: mentions dayday band</p>
<p>Stephen: suggests to link it to the stereo and automatically turn up the stereo, when a certain amount of decibel is reached</p>
<p>Ben needs an IOS developer who deals with health data</p>
<p>D: mentions source for funding that Ben could pitch to for free labour: red academy cohort</p>
<p>Kris: can connect Ben to a person, who won funds that may be relevant</p>
<p>Kris: suggests to check out book about OK Cupid data</p>
<p>D: mentions johnmillward.com (deep inside, a study of 10.000 pornstars…)</p>
<p>Kris: suggests a more inquisitive character for the app</p>
<p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>5) D – beer and coffee accountability tool</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Idea: </strong>It would be good to have an easy way to keep track of beer and coffee consumption at Creative Coworkers; not intended as a control tool, but more as an accountability help for people to keep track of their consumption and pay up when they feel like they should settle the bill.</p>
<p>Kris: suggests i button (one button for coffee, one button for beer), web app that sends data to spreadsheet</p>
<p>Ben: may be able to help, he knows people who can help</p>
<p>Kris: another option could be using two old androids, keep one at the coffee machine, one at the beer tab; everybody gets their individual number that they could key in – this way people could also look up their own tally</p>
