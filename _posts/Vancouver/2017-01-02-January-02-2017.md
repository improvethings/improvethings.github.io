2. Idea discussion
Tate:
Order digital screens from China in bulk from $15-$30 each
Get into restaurants by offering restaurants ads to upsell
Done by WiFi
Only costs are screens and install
Have to assume loss (e.g. 3%)
Can gamify the idea: Score for how accurate you ae peeing
Current cycle for outdoor advertising - 6 weeks
Vancouver Hackspace Tuesday nights may be able to help
Steve:
Sometimes you want to buy and prepare; other times, you want to buy something you can eat right away
Row of Vending Machines (5 or so machines)
Where can you open these?
Pender and Main (bank corner)
Maybe near skytrain stations
Need refridgerated machine so food lasts longer
No healthy vending machines that we know of in Vancouver
Can take requests for meal items from customers
Contact that operates a Food Technology Centre in North Van
Soylent: Nutritious to survive off of
Drip bars: Next-day IVs after partying/drinking
Altitude Performance and Health: Only CVAC pod in Canada - Simulate high altitude environments
Hot coffee machines in Korea; serves small, super hot
Cocktail/Beer vending machines currently exist that mixes ingredients
The building that Delina is in: Premium luxury building
Convenience Store: High-end 7-Eleven with a maitre'd
Elevated level of oxygen: risk of toxicity
Could also hack carbon dioxide in a room
Kris:
On Kris's website, blog post about what you can teach in 30 minutes
Google form with 3 things; Kris will select people to join group
Record all of these Google Hangout presentations
Format: Would there be a host? Anchor person might keep people coming back
Create a in-person community that will be free
Potentially an online community that will be monetized
Is 30 minutes the right amount of time?
Daily release of content drives traffic
Ideawave: Batch three 10-minute talks, followed by 10-15 minute block in between each batch of talks
Luke:
Huge community for aspiring writers
30,000 words per month
Could write beginning of a book and have other community members finish book
Famous authors have used Nano WriMo to help launch their writing careers
