<p>Ideas - 25 April 2016</p>
<p>Chair - Clayton<br />
Notes - Luke<br />
Twitter/SnapChat/BBS Storm - Kris</p>
<p>New members - 2. More people showed up later.</p>
<p>Clayton - No ideas; he's chairing</p>
<p>Steve - Product designer - Kickstarter next week. Looking for way to activate a large network for the campaign.</p>
<p>Dei - accountant-anylist. Idea: iPhone app to combine social networks to manage digital footprint. Combine and archive social media from, say, Skydrive and facebook. A way for users can specify a trustee for "digital treasures" to will to heirs. Also, search function to search what you did, say 2 years ago. It doesn't tell you what you have on Instagram or twitter, however.</p>
<p>Luke - sort of like digital scrapbooking. How about an AI that creates a scrapbook/autobiography for your life, as you live.<br />
Allanah - knows people who have small children and use social media to keep track of their lives. However, the public/control aspect of it is problematic.<br />
Chris - building [[http://www.sepio.com/][Sepio]], app that takes pictures of pictures to digitize physical photos.<br />
OtherChris - suspects the pain point will be working with a diversity of APIs you don't control. How to assuage the ire of those who control the APIs you use? Chris suggests using other platforms for your own platform, but switch off from it as soon as possible. Never do someone else' market research at your own expense.<br />
Dei - big problem is trust. How can we know that this database/organization will be around in 15, 25 years? Maybe an NPO? More transparency? Redundancy of database across multiple companies.<br />
Melody - what would this be if made in the 1980s? A VHS tape? With that in mind, what should the current technology be that will live a long time? Chris points out that a lot of information on the internet fades over time. What about $15/year to guarantee that your kids will get your data when they're grown up? Maybe put it on a tablet that is included in these earnings.</p>
<p>Kris -<br />
Idea: Open source project support system. Support company for priv/sec users out there.<br />
Redhat is (open-source) linux for which you buy support. Canonical made ubuntu which is still not as big as Redhat. There are a number of good priv/sec tools (Signal, Tor etc.). Imagine starting a company that offers support (to individuals and companies) for implementing usage of these tools. Also, spreads the use of these tools and legitimizes security tools. Company would not be in the USA because of Patriot act and NSL. Chris suggests "burner computers" and cycle them as distros change. How do we trust hadware? It's a big problem.</p>
<p>- Jewellery and Mother Earth. 3D scan a rock and 3D mill wood to hold the stone.<br />
- Talked about getting a mission-specific meetup.com account. Clayton questioned the benefit of a custom meetup group.</p>
<p>Jason - finished UBC in education. Has built a broadcasting service to reduce teacher screening process. For Asian companies. One-way interview technology. Getting clients, but slower than anticipated. Get more job seekers coming in.</p>
<p>How does a seeker know it's a good idea? 1) Free. 2) Multiple interviews 3) more holistic interview. Racial profiling and stereotyping is a problem. Preliminary screening (which might not even be effective even for the employer) is largely on looks/race. Focus of business is on asia-pacfic businesses hiring overseas ESL teachers. How does video interview solve these problems? Seeker can use their own device to answer customized (by employer?) questions to be shared with HR, school staff and community.</p>
<p>Why would schools favour a white person with limited non-english capacity over a bilingual asian person? It's all about the parents, who are, ultimately, paying for the service.</p>
<p>TeachAsia.ca. .com was too expensive. How is it better than phoning in on Skype? Time zone problems fixed, one-on-many. How can this sort of thing be used by consultants to find the idea business to work for/with?</p>
<p>Chris: does it need to be a new platform or can it just be a hub that uses existing social network tools.</p>
<p>Caleb - UI component to nudge values up or down.</p>
<p>Chris (sp?) - social media consulting that's very artesianal.</p>
<p>Melody (sp?) - Cris' sister. Interested in the essence of who we're reaching.</p>
<p>Doesn't want to use the term influencer? Who are your customers? Who are they influential with right now? Who's following who? Takes a lot of digging. If framed as "what can you do for me?" the answer is usually "nothing". If it's "What can I do for you?". Caleb mentioned [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Locke][Gonzo Marketing]]. One of the first marketers for Hootsuite by segmenting market space and potential customers and approached influencers in that space. Offered custom rub-on tattoos. Went from 5k to 6M users in a few years. Mailed thousands of custom packages, which had to be earned as a brand superstar. Packages cost about $.50 to make.</p>
<p>Melody and Chris did a event that included a personal sketch of the person. This blew up in positive feedback. Personal parts of social media posts that generate lots of interest.<br />
Jason wondering how to use it to help his problem (of marketing his job matching service).</p>
<p>Social media is older than the interent. Internet comes from social media (telephone) and social media doesn't have to be digital.</p>
<p>Did HS measure rate of applying tattoos? Conversion is an important metric.</p>
<p>Sandra - advertising. No ideas, so far.</p>
<p>Andrew - Math tutor, special ed. Interested in lesson and material design. To innovate pedagogy. Interested to start a team to rapid prototype superior math lessons with a UI/UX person. Particularly fractions. Targeted at students with difficulties, (not at) teachers. Not cram sessions. Melody was reading an article about different ways people struggle with spelling. In the short term, needs someone to work with worksheets to structure the lesson. To design the lesson ideally, takes 2 hours to make 5 minutes of lesson: play-testing lesson and checking against real-world student tests. Some discussion was around what sort of person/people would fill the job. Page layout/UI/UX would help with initial process. Tamsen: UX is about flow of information. UI is more look and feel. Very slow with LaTeX. Could you bring in an example next time? Jason asked for clarification on what the worksheet/curriculum would be like. Can students do it by themselves? Maybe an adult/tutor/mentor would still be needed. Tamesen: what is your special sauce. Andrew: "my method is mathematically correct". All textbooks are incorrect, especially about fractions. BC textbooks say "fractions are a part of a whole", which is invalidated by, for example, 4/3. Luke - who could step up to this task? Clayton suggested a x-pollination of Chris/Melody's social strategy, Jason's app and Andew's methodology. Kris suggested a friend from Peterborough who might want to collaborate. Alesia Blackwood from Unlock Math</p>
<p>Clayton asked how a lesson would look.</p>
<p>Brennan - just floating. Ask Brennan if you have a question.</p>
<p>Luke - energy balance of the earth. How much energy would the world need to fix all the f***k-ups of previous generations, and how can we get there? If we can get enough energy, could we make the world even cleaner/calmer/steadier that it has been in human history? Can we _lower_ sea levels, for example? What level on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale][Khardashev Scale]] do we need to be?<br />
- 4k monitor experience?</p>
<p>Thewirecutter.com suggest the Dell U2415, and they suggest the 2415Q 4k monitor. Right now there's a sale right now on the 4k monitor and it's cheaper than the 1920x1200 monitor.</p>
<p>Chris uses a linux box called elemetary. Has used a 4k monitor for gaming.</p>
<p>Stephen - talks about other people's ideas.</p>
<p>Tamsen - human-centred design consultant. New business in the space of digital safety. Conducting and exercise. Online vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Survey: Have you ever been scared of afraid of having your identity online? Scale of 1-10, how scared were you? Question posed: is fear different from embarrassment? Results were a full spectrum of 0-10. One was no/5. Some discussion of why some people answered 0, some 10/10 because when younger, dirty laundry was online. Discussion of interpretations - some saw it as credentials (which are replaceable), while others thought it was about anonymity. Kris related anecdote of hackers having a spat on IRC, hackers found real-world phone number and started to hassle by phone, turning into a 2-year harassment problem. FBI got involved, put him under witness protection. Got divorced, lots his job and more.</p>
<p>Next round:<br />
In 2020, what's the main reason you're worried about:<br />
1) Personal Brand<br />
2) Credentials that control my life<br />
3) Business and professional presence<br />
4) Someone I care about</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Much discussion about various specific topics. Telepresence impersonation. Societal acceptance of practice and norms can change very fast. Social life online persists past the malleability of norms. Talked about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing][Doxing]], how it can be used for good (social benefit) or evil. Clones: human clones wrecking your stuff. But might they be even better? FUD, mass hacking, teen bullying, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting][SWATting]].</p>
<p>Next round:<br />
If you were to come to a digital training workshop next week, what are the 2 things you'd like to learn? How much would you pay for this 2.5 hour workshop.</p>
<p>Caleb would pay $150 to detect penetration had happened, and to detect man-in-the-middle attack. Luke thinks he might know more that a workshop for the masses, but still wants to learn a lot more. Luke suggested education that can be passed on to one's family/social group?</p>
<p>Clayton - what's the biggest blocker right now? Learning about the space is hard for Tamsen. Working with Kris is time-sensitive as Kris has a few things going on.</p>
<p>Jobs next week (Monday, 2 May):<br />
Minutes: Sandra<br />
Chair: Unknown</p>
