#### Ideas

#### Kris
* 3 day weekend or friday night where we go somewhere? Maybe on the island. First step would be to go check out AirBnB and see whats there? 
* Also should we have an agenda? Or a limit?
* What's the intention? Just a big ideas weekend? Get a Shaman in there? 
* It depends on weekend and the budget? it will help knowing what we want to do.
* We would have to rent a car to go to the island though.
* Maybe we can work from there too.
* if you can get everyone to put in $50, you can get a castle in Spain!
* Maybe you can get some crazy rich house in West Van
* Each member can facilitate something they're interested in.
* Possibly we can have some facilitation within the core group and then grow from there in subsequent "workshops"
* Should do a [Decision Tree](https://decisiontree.io) poll for this?
* What dates should we do?


#### Judgement Exercise
* Every one present is going to private write 5 immediate judgements they have about each other on a piece of paper. These will be read out by Kris anonymously to the whole group. This is an exercise to expose your immediate judgements about other people.
* We can do this at the retreat as well.

#### Plea for help
* Sourcing raw material from factories
* Talking to naturceutical company (something that doesn't require clinical trial)
