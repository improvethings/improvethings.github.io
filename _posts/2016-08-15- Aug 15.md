Ideas meeting Monday 15 August

Michael

Last week Stephen and I talked about making this more accessible to new-comers.

Introducing: Option to redact the idea/person from the meeting minutes.

Ideas

Stephen - Meta Discussion on how we can improve Ideas Meetings.

After last meeting Michael and Stephen rode together and discussed how ideas can be improved.

There were 15 people last week and it was difficulty to get ideas out there for everyone. 
It was a surprise to some that the meeting was 3 hours long. 

Mike and Stephen talked about how we can make ideas more appealing to more people, while maintaining quality.

One of the things we can talk about is how people experience the meeting. Is it okay to run out of time? How would it be possible to discuss fewer ideas at the meetings?  Reaching plateaus for ideas and making it okay to talk to some other week.

One way could be to do 2 hour meetings, and people who are interested to talk more, can do a post-meeting.
2 + 1 idea? Riz thinks that the new comer system is good - 2+1 would be beneficial existing people.

Luke - 

When anyone comes here they want to get their idea heard. I also get bored if there are ideas that I’m not really interested in and I start to lose focus. 

John - Adding an inter-mission in the middle of the meeting? 

Riz - Is it possible to have a signal to move it on because that seems like the challenge to me. I want to know when I’m rambling…

Stephen - What do you feel about having fewer ideas?

Kris - just try it. Can we do a voting for ideas at the end? 

Stephen - Introduce some filters for the idea? Is it a business? Is it Philosophical?

Luke - DIY Dharma format - last meet of the month: Last chairman selects the format. Point is that you can change the format as you go?

Bill - What happens to the creative process when you put a time limit on it?

Yana - Lets have a timer and discuss with the group if we should continue on an idea.

Mile - Whoever chairs decides what innovation they need to bring.

Is it dollars? It could be real-dollars as well. 
Could it be a netflix type of thing for watching the adds?.

Bill

Management/Environmental consultant. 

Is there a way to facilitate homeowners to coordinate the sale of their properties so developers can make their lots in one go.

Think about property in Vancouver. Frustrated at the economics of property in Vancouver.
Ownership to property is a high barrier to high density.

Can we facilitate potential sellers of low density properties and they all sell at the same time to help the development get bigger lots.
Creatie seller groups of owners of properties. Can you do an auction between different building developers? Is it better to sell collectively?
Can you quantify the benefit for people?

Open market pricing for homes? Can you create incentives for non-financial benefits in a particular area. Government rezoning has a process as well.
