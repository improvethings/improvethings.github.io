### Vegan food kiosks - Ivan
*Long-time dream

*Shipping malls/offices for locations
*Franchises?

*Focus on natural Mexican products
*(“wall sausage” relation)
* Challenges?
* Attracting ppl who are not vegan to gain interest in trying?
* Make it appealing w a “pop” factor or USP
* Lack of experience in restaurant business

#### Community discussion
* Why the expenses of brick & mortar or food trucks if minimal staff is goal, why not just “vending
machines” for no staff
* Education is also a goal targeting obesity issue in Mexico
* Most important detail? Location
* Foot traffic
* Lease commitment (ensure you can sub-lease in case of bailout)
* Viral coefficient like “squats for free taco”
* Use stats/data vs instinct i.e. search where the demand is not where you feel it will be good
*  Keep menu simple/inexpensive/comprehensive but interesting
* Tastings around different “hot spots” for feedback, integrate with social media for exposure
* Check current offerings on vegan restaurants and check reviews for what ppl want
* Quality and consistency across kiosks ~logistics
* Japan as role model

### Websites for small and medium ent. - Lena
* Focusing on coaches
* Cookie cutter websites but HQ
* Headless?
* Community discussion
* How can AI help?
* What processes or team would you need? Coding/etc
* Packages: web development and host it and/or subscribe for security of website
* Could be attractive if implementing foot traffic funneling
* Structure scheduling into websites for coaching services
* Pricing based on templates
* Proof of concept: company that focus on web dev for therapists
* Easier to market towards a specific group vs broad or multiple industries
* Advertising very important
* [Durable.co](https://durable.co)
* [Jane app](https://jane.app/) (therapy targeted) scheduling/video all built in
* [betterhelp.com](https://betterhelp.com) most popular web for therapist seeking
* try not to focus on landing page, focus on additional value
* seek another team if current team is not able to jump aboard same train of vision
* Challenges
* To already have a solid foundation targeting a specific group (lack of focus)
* FOMO causing this spread of effort, wanting a piece of many cakes
* Low funds
* Very saturated space

* Self-eval tool
* feed it personality traits, uses AI to tell you unique skill sets and weaknesses based on traits
* green flags vs red flags to look for in partner/relationship
* anonymous
* integrate into dating app that matches you based off of compatibility
* Challenges?
* Dating world is currently fucked for many reasons
* Community discussion
* Usually sell to match.com (dating ideas)
* Men starved to be heard
* Market it for self improvement rather than dating?
* Good if could be used for exploration of self/ finding oneself after feeling lost
* Would you use it?
* for self improvement more likely than for dating, to improve on positive points
* What are the criteria for deciding if two people will be a match?
* Risk of not being attracted to each other after matching

and..
LONG
