## Agenda

* (Derekja) I'm working on a TEDxVictoria talk proposal on biohackerspaces. It's not polished, but if I may I'd like to run a rough draft past you all and have a discussion around it. I've got class until 8pm, so I'll be a bit late. Probably ought to share some makerspace status as well.

## Minutes

No real minutes last night, but I'll add a few links

makerspace status
    
* opened metalworking bay
* laser and forge classes these next two weeks. Welding in Oct.
* Derek is opening a startup downtown and will be loaning the makerspace some of the space for downtown events in electronics and biology
* specifically, arduino hack nights combined with the stanford AI lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6pm, 2614 Bridge Street unit 210 starting Oct. 10th

Biology stuff
    
 * Derek was down teaching and building the lab at [http://biocurious.org](http://biocurious.org/) for the summer
 * bringing some of that back here this fall
 * new podcast series at [http://garagebio.org](http://garagebio.org/)
    
TEDxVictoria talk proposal

* increase in sequencing and synthesis
* biology as an information science
* importance of mixing disciplines and biohackerspaces
    
Some of the talk focused on security concerns and I wanted to post the main
regulations on lab security:

[http://www.ccac.ca/Documents/Standards/lbg_2004_e.pdf](http://www.ccac.ca/Documents/Standards/lbg_2004_e.pdf)

That's the main document establishing regulations and best practices for
Canadian labs, including the expanded human pathogens regs.

Also, the legislation that was discussed resulting from the UBC incident was
the human pathogens and toxins act, but it does not cover non-pathogenic
strains of E. coli:

"Thank you for contacting our Directorate.

The answer to your question can be found in the FAQ section of our website:
[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/faq-
eng.php](http://www.phac-
aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/faq-eng.php)

> Q. I have a non-pathogenic strain of E-coli (K-12), but E. coli is listed in Schedule 2 of the Act. Does this mean that I have to register?
    
> No. E. coli is listed in Schedule 2.  However, this does not mean that all strains of E. coli fall within Risk Group 2.  If you have established that the strain you have is indeed K-12, then it does not fall into Risk Group 2, as it is a non-pathogenic strain i.e. cannot cause disease in a human.
    
Based on this, you are not required to registed under the Human Pathogen and Toxin Act. "
