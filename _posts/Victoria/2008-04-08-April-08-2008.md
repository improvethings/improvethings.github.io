As it appears there have been no meetings recently, there have. Just no one is
stepping up to the plate to take minutes. As such, I will at least try to
summarize the meetings so you get a sense of what the meeting was about.

* We followed [green drinks](http://www.greendrinks.org/)
* Talked about emergency preparedness again.

What type of emergencies are you, or should you be prepared for? Under the
current climate the biggest fear is an economic/social emergency. One member
is talking about building an emergency kit and storing it under water, near a
remote island we could sail to

* Discussed a few of us taking sailing lessons and buying a communal sailboat
* We are going to try a 10-mile diet, based off the 100-mile diet idea.
* We discussed going vertical instead of horizontally because we have small properties. Perhaps eavesdrop fed tubes.
* We should meet with [Compost BC](http://www.compost.bc.ca/) and get their feedback
* One guest is starting a sensor company, he will work with a few of our members next week to test his accelerometer device
* One guest is visiting with the National museum conference
