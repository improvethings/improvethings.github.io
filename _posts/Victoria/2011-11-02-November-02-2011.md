    * [Serious Coffee (in development)](http://seriouscoffee.mobilewebsitemarkets.com/)
* Kris, Kevin and Herb to talk to Catherine about Peeper, an app that allows people to quickly post short 10 second video clips (like Twitter but for videos), and then show thumbnail images for viewers to get a summary of posted video clips and easily find interesting ones to watch. A website that does something similar, but for adult related material, can be seen at the following link, ATTENTION THIS LINK IS NSFW: [http://www.pinklab.com](http://www.pinklab.com/)
