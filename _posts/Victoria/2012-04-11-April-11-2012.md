* [CIRA's proposed governance changes](http://cira.ca/legal/governance/)
* This page is confusing!
* [Kevin's take](http://www.unrest.ca/cira-governance)
* CIRA should be democratically driven!
* The public should always have a role
* It's our internet
* Freedom is chosen not imposed
* Why the increased concentration in power?
* What's wrong with the way things are done now? Why not just meet the new non-profit act instead of being used opportunistically? 
* Ivory tower
* [DOJ ebook settlement](http://blog-admin.wired.com/epicenter/2012/04/doj-terms-settlement-ebook/)
* [http://friesenpress.com/home](http://friesenpress.com/home) Friesen Press] local publishing company
* Kevin's AdvancedPHP second book was cancelled mid-writing because they refused to remove DRM
* Disability support services don't work with DRM
* Kris suggesting someone create a site that publishes only non-DRM books (pirate parties, reddit etc would support)
* [No starch press](http://www.nostarch.com/)
* Academics choose books to read based on quality of publisher... MIT press books always read first over Basic books publishing as the quality level is guaranteed higher
* At the academic level won't take things that are "open access", it's seen as 4th class in a 2 class world
* Stigma against self-publishing
* Convince the American government to apply the Sherman act 
* We were hopeful the ebook revolution would have resolved these issues in the physical book world
* Issues around the no-DRM book club (self-published, small and medium) 
    * Stigma around editing level with self-publishing (lack of quality control) 
        * Standardize
        * Editorial board need (staffing!)
        * A rating system
    * Is the talent going to buy into it
    * Lack of access to DRM hardware (Kindle)
    * Legal backing publishers provide
    * Issue getting into Chapters (physical/print book space) - Channel distribution
    * Small to medium market share
    * Consumers knowing about the issue
* [W J Gilmore](http://www.wjgilmore.com/) (involved in Kevin's book)
* [Self-esteem prophecies sold + 10k](http://www.confidencemanual.com/fear/self-fulfilling-prophecy.htm)
* [Apress](http://www.apress.com/) you can buy non-DRM books here, including Kevin's
* Next gen fiction based publishing is possible - Chris P
* Are authors looking for prestige, or cash. Each of the things above force you to choose one or the other.
* Gatekeeper and Gatekeeping 
* ebooks are the big mac of publishing - Rob Wipond
* Novels are more of the market than technical manuals
* Prior to 1970 you could stake out a piece of land and build yourself a ~30 acre homestead
* Apply to the province for a pre-emption claim
* Why did they get rid of pre-emption?
* [Preemption and homestead guide](http://www.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/BC_Research_Guide/BC_Pr_Emptn_Hmstd.aspx)
* [PDF: Homesteading and Property Rights; Or, "How the West Was Really Won"](http://www.sfu.ca/~allen/homesteading.pdf)
* Most of the province is unused crown land
* Can we do this? 
* Search Hansard from the Land Act
* Does the public understand public land vs crown (private property that belongs to the queen) land? 
* Queen -> Governor General -> Lt. General -> Legislature
* Why did the top 1/2 of Vancouver island fail with homesteading? (Scandanavians?)
* Lock in + Growth in Employment negotiations
* [Jiro: Dreams of sushi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/news)
* [Stiring it up](http://www.stirringitup.org/)
