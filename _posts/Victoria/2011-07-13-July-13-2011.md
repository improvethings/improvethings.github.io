## Video Lab

* Scott and Dave
* idea: media net but as a progressive organization. Media net began as a collective in the 70s to share equipment, and is now funded by the feds. Equipment includes computers and they run workshops on how to use it.
* workshop is $200
* socially active documentary stuff that is supported with/through the NFB
* worry that because tool is so accessible that their services are now in question
* planning to try to work in innovative and interactive technologies. Aim is to bring these technologies to members.
* workshop in a few weeks takes place at media net office and what is created will be shown on the August 1-10 in a gallery
* presently short a few participants and they want some tech people to get involved with their creative side and vice versa
* benefit to all skills is that there is an open space (gallery on Fort Street) at the end to build what they want for the open space exhibit
* have a space for a week to prepare and run exhibits
* for it to officially run they need another two people - tech people would be great to pair with artists
* potentially in the future would pair a video person, artist, and programmer to create projects and turn into competition
  
## Startup Canada

* spin off of startup America
* entrepreneurs at Oxford established a series of startup systems, where government money and mentorship are devoted to encouraging hot new companies
* Startup Canada will include Bell and Rogers to provide free media to entrepreneurs
* looking for partners to go to government so that entrepreneurs can be featured in the media; aim is to get people interested in entrepreneurship and stimulate economy by them instead of large companies
* as spinoff tell story about entrepreneurs and thus enhance/encourage their businesses
* right now at grassroots

## Infocus Rehabilitation

* provides on the ground support for people who have suffered neurological injury (strokes, soldiers, etc)
* aim is to provide rehabilitation to these people who have significant mobility issues
* equipment is horrid right now; want to replace it with iPads
* aim is to move people to iPads and replicate existing modes of communication but then go further and increase their quality of life
* want to provide people with training with tools to help those who are suffering injury
* want to cover software and apps that will cover 80% of the job to help, and then figure out the 20% that needs to be subsequently established
* in the early stages; wants to think about the technology complications that may not be immediately event to end-users
* would something like a universal control (e.g an arduino help)?
* challenge is getting an appliance that really works in an effective manner; challenge is often related to money
* proloc software (and related types) can help with home automation. Ram-mounts are helpful in making a device more accessible for those with mobility issues; Kevin uses with his boat (see: [http://www.ram-mount.com/](http://www.ram-mount.com/))
* there is a challenge in interface as well as breaking down psychological barriers to using them (as well as different requirements to using them)
* emotive from TED has been involved in these sorts of issues/works

* Kris' offers: brain machine; DNA sequencing

* question is whether in the future DNA sequencing could be used to change the nature of the actuarial industry and formulation/management of risk. Could it drive price down?
* given attitudes to our approach as risks/actionable such sequencing would be problematic
* perhaps need to shift from defensive to management then conditions would change quite a bit and redefine the condition of receiving medial information
