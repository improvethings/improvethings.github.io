## Homework

* Generate a QR code of your business card (vcard format) and bring it with you. (Google "generate vcard QR code" for several sites that do this)
* Download QR code scanning software for your smart phone

Tonight instead of exchanging business cards, we will save trees and scan QR
codes instead. It will be interesting to see how the different smart phones
react

## QR Codes

Nokia bar code scanner: couldn't open the latest QR code

i-nigma software: couldn't open the new type of bar codes, were showing "3.0"
instead of the content (on both iphone and Nokia)

Quickmark was the clear winner, worked on Nokia and iphone, was able to
generate and read the latest QR codes

Can we compress content into QR-codes, like a book?

[Maximum lossless compression](http://www.maximumcompression.com/index.html)

We decided to see how much we can fit into a QR code. It turns out 2000 bytes
is the max on the latest QR codes. So we decided to test out lossless
compression on text documents and then run into a QR code.

Not much software out there for decoding QR codes.

Some interesting findings; the first 4300 bytes off the Wikipedia
steganography page compresses to 2000 bytes with bzip2 or 2027 bytes with
gzip. - Kris

## Bitcoin

[Free bitcoins](https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/)

Are currencies controlled by communities or government?

the value of $5 is if I'm willing to part with it and if you're willing to
negotiate for it - DN

the expansion of money comes from loans - DN

No currency you can't create more of will ever succeed - TB

Current exchange rate is about ~~50~~ 35 cents USD for 1 bitcoin
