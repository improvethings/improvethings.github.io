The event starts at 7p.m, at [Community Micro Lending](http://communitymicrolending.ca/contact)! All open minded critical thinkers are welcome!

The theme this week is " **... this is upcycling. opportunism in waste** "

You have between now and June 5th to upcycling something, and bring it in to demo.

For some ideas, try [images.google.com](https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1361&bih=601&q=upcycling&oq=upcycling&gs_l=img.3..0l10.4429.5885.0.6246.9.5.0.4.4.0.52.160.5.5.0...0.0.0..1ac.1.12.img.ferAk4G-rjQ) or [pinterest](http://pinterest.com/compai/upcycled/), but bonus points if you come up with something unique!

If you don't have anything upcycled or you're not feeling creative, come check out the creations of others anyway!
