* * *

invention technology company (money!) living to work or working to live

* work hard for more money

from that you can buy a faster car that you don't drive faster

president says "go shop " immediately after 911

we live in a culture of consumption

social status - tie to life longevity

social status - is not class

There are other means to increase ones social status other than money:

* respect of your peers
* stable social networks
* leisure time
* stable health care
* social safety net

THESE are measure of success of your children and life expectancy

money can create negative impacts unlike the others

* How much you walk is the biggest determinant of your health

with no skills in Canada:

* work in the oil fields of Alberta or Yellowknife
* pornography or gambling industries
* stupid people compete here - obviously low hanging fruit

* I'd rather be more interested than happy
* Rich people don't have better ideas

* Are you spending more time (trying to) acquiring wealth than doing things that are
* TV etc, how many distractions do have that prevent us from doing interesting things like

reading books, hikes

* Golfing makes you spend your day chatting with maybe 3 people
* Basketball = more people, thus more disussion

* The 3 ways someone becomes rich: inherit. pursued. lucky. 

* Wealth is the enemy of quality
* Important and interesting work comes out of being constrained
* One needs to find the balance between 

* Constraints you have from not being wealthy open the same doors if you're interesting

* Grants (usually) suck, your work is politics
* Wealth - above and beyond the necessities

* Unless you have specific things that require riches to accomplish you probably won't get wealth.
* Those that won't meet their objectives, they're probably just seeking riches

negatives of someone being rich -

* we need to remove the need for consumption

* Status fundamentally makes one happy, riches are one minute resource for that

* social status - attempting to get rich, shows you're trying to hard to get social status because you don't have it

* social status and wealth is not interchangeable suggests one member

* money = currency or resources?!!?
* fundamentally, all commodities are currency (Money is backed up by some central bank in some nation)

[Sapir Whorf
Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-
Whorf_hypothesis)

* One visitor accused a member of trying to modify the argument yet avoiding the main point

* * *

* We should create a facebook event
* We should have a social/bbq
* Check out lawn bowling

creative vs social technical people are more creative? it's a freedom thing --
creativity

pushing social boundaries some of the time you will fail to be safe is to be a
social animal
