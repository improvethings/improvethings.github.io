### Independent media

* Tabled to next meeting as no-one to bring the discussion forward

### Co-working space

* Not really a good space that's not a bedroom to work for nomadic workers
* Other cities have co-working spaces
* Evan is trying to either find or create a co-working space. Contact Evan Willms 250.661.6401 coworking@evanwillms.com - may be good to start cheap and small and grow
* Principles: collaboration, community and openness
* Two people at Victoria Real Estate Board are actively looking for a space and possible subsidies
* There is a co-working space in Rock Bay--there is high turnover--most either find it too expensive or use it to start up a company and then get too large - Jamie may be able to find out who
* Raincoast Business Centre - but those are offices -- so not a social environment
* Datatech at Quadra and McKenzie, Evergreen at Borden and McKenzie
* There are others who are looking for this kind of space
* Goal is less $300 for anytime access to a co-working space
* Some have a full-time and/or drop-in rates
* Model could be co-op, non-profit, or corporate
* Co-op model means that people have more individual buy-in
* UVic has [Centre for co-operative studies](http://www.bcics.org/)

### Urban Gardening

* Looking for shared garden spaces
* [Lifecycles gardens](http://www.sharingbackyards.com/browse/Victoria,%20BC&welcome_box=2) [life-cycles sharing backyards](http://lifecyclesproject.ca/)
* Oak bay limits the size of your garden
* [Balcony farm](http://thetyee.ca/Books/2011/05/17/BalconyFarm/)
* Kris' hops are growing 1 foot/day--looking to move his hops to his ultra-modern condo
* [Island Grains](http://www.islandgrains.com/)
* Chickens - crackdown on urban agriculture - Rules changed passed as food safety, only industrial agriculture is ok - so that birds, chickens, turkeys - all animals can't be slaughtered on your farm, they have to be slaughtered elsewhere. Local farmers are not raising animals because it's not cost-effective to ship animals to Vancouver to be slaughtered. As opposed to open-air slaughter as show in [Food Inc.](http://www.foodincmovie.com/). People are not raising chickens.
* Illegal milk runs in Vancouver - the industrial food lobby doesn't want us to have locally raised animals
* Do-it-yourself slaughter your own live chicken
* What grows quickly that you can harvest regularly: get planters that are designed for balconies (boxes): spinach, lettuce, tomatoes, strawberries, peas, rosemary, oregano, radishes
* You cannot grow strawberries from seeds, need to get the stolons
* [UN Agenda 21 on sustainable development](http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/)

### Registration Process for Ideas Meeting

* Not everyone on Facebook, twitter
* Maybe have a form for meetings so that we can know for meetings what is the best way to access/notify people about meetings times and changes - let's have a sign-up form
* Mediawiki hook and a facebook hook
* Ryan Steele had set up a way to amalgamate different contact methods for ideas vic - Kris for contact

### ALPR

* Kris part of Privacy and Access Committee for BC Civil Liberties Association
* BC Civil Liberties does have an issue with all the surveillance taking place
* Within 100 days no more will the government will need warrant or subpoenas to gather information from private companies
* Kris talked to director for policy for BCCLA - if we do the ALPR demo, they can do a joint release
* We need to make the demo polished as well as sooner rather than later
* Kevin to provide Kurt with sample video to run through the ALPR software
* Kurt will optimize the software so that it can be run from a laptop and provide reliable real-time recognition of a video stream
* Once the software is set up and working we'll make a day of collecting data

### Protest Against Protests/Protest To End Protests

* Puppet with protesters
* Accountability - we now civilian oversight
* Mocking protesters, not going against the police

### Mini- bills

* Possibility of Awesome Shit Club going into schools
* Mini-bill card with the list of projects associated with the ideas club

* Promotion of ideas meetings by mini-bills
