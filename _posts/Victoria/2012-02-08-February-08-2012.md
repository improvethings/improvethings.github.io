## Agenda

* Rob's secret question for techies that he doesn't want linked to him in the minutes - RW
* [Reverse Engineering class](http://www.ideasmeetings.org/wiki/REclass) \- KC
* [ASC](http://www.awesomeshitclub.com/) \- KC
* [IdeaWave](http://www.ideawave.ca/) \- KC
* Feedback from the club president about the Bruce Gillespie incident from last year that is still unresolved - KC
* Three days of food safety on the island, should we try it? - KC

## Minutes

* [Reverse eng class](http://www.ideasmeetings.org/wiki/REclass) \- taking apart software, hobby level
* how long should it be, what to include and how fast to go, who will teach it? Maybe have goals for each class to achieve/ get to a certain level by end of session.
* Kevin: "it's like trying to teach poetry without knowing what love is"
* trying get my hands on a raspberry pi (not a pie :) - micro computer for $25/Euros35 similar to capabilities of a phone - programmable. lots of RAM, HD processor etc. Orders are limited to 1 per household...it's the size of a credit card, available next month.
* Intro class would be attractive, ie earlier stages instead of full indepth course.
* When would work best? not weekends, wayward school run classes so Kris looking into using space there.
* [Crypto Class](http://www.crypto-class.org/) \- Stanford also running other courses (natural language processing, design anal of algs, security, etc)
* code academy - anyone else doing the class? remote coding class.
* [Security Class](http://www.security-class.org/)
* MIT also do classes
* [Learning ASM](http://www.darknet.org.uk/2008/09/modern-exploits-do-you-still-need-to-learn-assembly-language-asm/)
* Kris's binary classes continue also :)
* 2 hrs a week proposed

* ASC
* was awesome! nearly sold out - final 3 were Makerspace, Olio Collective and Mesh Mesh who will be presenting on thursday at Odeon Theatre 2 before the movie 'Something Ventured'
* Entire audience can vote for who wins the cash so your $10 gets you tickets to the movie and a vote!

* Get tickets online beforehand to avoid disappointment...to Vanessa.

* Ideawave
* More talks required! Speak for 10 mins, anyone can submit.
* Janice Mansfield - newest Ideawave talk to register
* Drinking fernet for 30 days - see youtube for the series of 30 Days of Fernet Branca [day 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZcO8j73imc&feature=related)

* Ian Soutar is speaking at Ideawave -"uranium is my friend" Natural nuclear Radiation used for medicinal purposes?
* Radiation at low levels can be good for your health - areas where found have low genetic mutations - beaches in India are low level radioactive; locals know to take a pillow to the beach because if you lay your head onto the sand, you may lose some hair! [Terrestrial Sources of Radiation](http://resources.yesican-science.ca/trek/radiation/final/earth_sources.html) ...could be a good place to holiday to avoid the waxing?! Radiation tourism is coming!
* A building where hospital grade cobalt was blended into the steel structure were above average health
* Device brought along (Revigator) contains radium ore - produces radioactive water! Ian plans to bath in it! Geiger counter reads 16,000 microsieverts (ÂµSv)
* European hot springs - cannot be used if you're a smoker
* Wiki description here [radiation hormesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis)
* Biologically beneficial treatment available
* [T.D. Luckey](http://www.radpro.com/641luckey.pdf) always referenced to topic - he's 93 so...
* Uranium beads - worn all the time - bought at beadworld in market square!!
* Also has ring which emits gamma rays, used for acupuncture. emits 85 microsieverts. can be used to sterilize medical equipment.
* Has proven to be beneficial with arthritis, diabetes, sun spots and general immunity to infections.
* Quadra Island has source of natural radioactive material.
* The stone he carries has a half life of approx 4 billion years, ie the radiation is given off very slowly, compared to Fukushima type levels
* [Radiation Network](http://www.radiationnetwork.com/) gives real time levels of radiation for North America
* Stimulates the production of endorphines
* Marketable radiation products for pain therapy, elimination of allergies, boosts immune system, etc, but could the word radiation be substituted with something less scare-inducing?!
* Conventional cancer treatment destroys dna at too higher levels but a gradual release of radiation is beneficial as it regenerates dna, or boosts dna mechanism
* [Medicine Man](http://www.nighthawkminerals.com/)
* Ottawa Uni has low level research centre - largest group in the world, underfunded. 
* Chernobyl discussed - most of problem with drifting radiation due to plants burning and water vapour mixing with radioactive particles, then forming clouds etc.
* [100 years of radon therapy](http://www.radscihealth.org/rsh/docs/Radon/RnTherapiesIndex.htm) \- doc

* The BG incident
* KM suggested because of the guests we take this discussion offline
* Lorne mentioned that ideas is just a group of club members, it's not an official activity that has a chair. He also mentioned that Kris is not the chair of ideas, but Robert Trevor is. He said as there is no chair, each individual should raise their concern instead of going through one person.
* KM again suggested it be taken outside of the meeting
* KC to follow up with individuals who raised the issue to ask them how they'd like to proceed.

* 3 days of food security
* upcoming article being written - is anyone interested to test out the theory that Vancouver Island would only have 3 days of food supply?
* Theory was proposed by Thrifty's employee... not actually true if not eg a geological disaster, but it really depends on what situation and under what criteria do you want to try and survive?! 
* With what you have in your house right now, how long could you survive? Have you got your emergency pack ready?
* Majority of people admit that they probably aren't prepared properly, but could get by for a few days...
* Could be interesting to coordinate something with VEMA, transition victoria, etc.
