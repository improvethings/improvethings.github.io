## Agenda

* Ideas as a political party 
    * Electoral reform: Can we agree on an electoral process?
    * Firearms registry vs Gun licence
* Acquiring something leuco dye or something thermochromic
* Making [this](http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/6985/711b24812ec1513c7af6bda.gif)
* Creating political / governance / monarchist movement to accelerate re-claiming of our country in which 60% of our people voted for change
* Electronic voting

## Minutes

* Results of election kind of depressing
* Some perspectives on Elizabeth May

* Electoral reform 
    * NDP and Green are pro-electoral reform - proportional representation
    * European parliament has proportional representation
    * STV (Single Transferable Vote) might be able to game it
    * Ontario tried mixed-member proportionate (some members elected directly, some proportionate)
    * Maybe convert Senate to a proportional house
    * Conservatives likely to open constitution changes to abolish senate
    * Could imply revising the Charter of Rights of Freedoms -- remove privacy
    * Change recall legislation so that the minimum requirement to pass is 75% of voter turnout from the previous election, not 60% of citizens when fewer than that actually vote.
    * Blue Bridge referendum example of voting
    * Kurt's system of 10... perhaps modified based on Kevin's polling maps
    * The opposition can walk out of the house and the Governor General can dissolve the house
    * 100 days until warrantless wiretapping is allowed
    * Civil test to allow for voting instead of a voting age of 18
    * Example of double-barreled survey [City of Victoria Official Community Plan Survey](http://www.shapeyourfuturevictoria.ca/get-involved/ocp-draft-feedback-survey/) \- questions should be single questions, hard to interpret - how governments survey the public to manipulate the question to get the answer they want. So the Official Community Plan just provides justification for the plan without actually getting valid public feedback
    * Citizenship test would likely mean much younger voters, 10 or 12... although more easily to propagandize.
    * Robert Heinlein had the concept of citizen and non-citizen

* Firearms registry vs Gun licence 
    * Conservatives committed to remove long-gun registry
    * 2 day course to buy and use guns
    * Criminals are not using illegal firearms
    * Police respond differently if there are guns
    * Requirement for long-gun registry -- was that evidence-based
    * Science has not always got things right, which is why science-based arguments don't carry as much weight

* Creating political / governance / monarchist movement to accelerate re-claiming of our country in which 60% of our people voted for change 
    * Viewership of the Royal Wedding indicates some love of the monarchy

* Electronic Voting 
    * Kevin figured out a way to inject CAs into an NSS directly without trust/popups
    * Propose an e-voting system, publish it, and we'll show you how to compromise it.
    * Kurt: fake people can donate to political campaigns, so people wanting to go over the limit just use fake names
    * Revenue Canada: Would they be willing to give out the aggregate data showing if the ratio shows that they are using fake people
    * Bill C24 in 2003 -> Accountability act of April 11, 2006: Removed donations by corporations and unions;
    * Does an election have to happen within 12 hours?
    * Vancouver (Christy Clark) says she wants it to go forward 
        * fairvote bc against e-voting

* Credit card fraud is huge 
    * CIO of BC said at Reboot Privacy and Security conference this year that CC companies are moving responsibility from them to merchant and customer

* Under 100 meteres cubed is the all of the gold that has ever been mined 
    * Tyler thinks gold is useless even though he trades in it, Kevin disagrees
    * Pre-1983 pennies are all copper -- thus worth more than a penny

* HTML5 frameworks 
    * [z-type](http://mozillalabs.com/gaming/)

* The suggested death of Obama 
    * It is suggested: 
        * He was unarmed
        * In Pakistan; what if Pakistani special forces took out their high profile targets on American soil
