## Agenda

* ( open data / open gov discussion moved to next week )

### New news/media based website for Victoria only initially

* Take video clips from CHEK news, articles from the TC, post them with attribution
* Can also take non-mainstream news from sources, like blogs or twitter, where the user chooses to publish to our website
* Community driven site where users can make corrections to the articles for technical correctness or to disclose bias
* Makes community trust and accurate based, instead of popularity based 
    * Perhaps room for relevance judging as well, it may be too technically difficult to implement
* News sources (main stream and not) get a score based on their general accuracy of correctness
* News subscribers can filter based on this score
