## Agenda

Discussion on
[satellites](http://hackepedia.org/?title=Satellites)

## Minutes

* As one member recently purchased a house, and another was negotiating the purchase of a house, the discussion was based around home and land ownership
* All members seem interested in creating edible gardens
* Discussion around using hydroponics on vertical tubes with 'shelves' throughout, wondering how high one can go (with peas, for example)
* As most of us are transplants, we are going to look into what advantages we have locally being in such a moderate climate with extended growing season
* There seems to be a 'back to basics' mood for most members, being as self-sustaining as we can.
* Wondering if there is any reason why we keep grass on our lawns, and not make them completely garden. 
* One member brought his new macbook air to demonstrate
