## Minutes

### Attending

* Kris, Lorne, Ernie, Jacob, Kevin, Kurt

### Meeting Space Scheduling Conflicts

* History 
    * This group may have been pushed around by the scheduling of the club
    * Lorne is here to discover what the issues are around the scheduling
    * The club went through a crisis when the city wanted to remove the club
    * The club pulled through the crisis successfully
    * The club has a policy and procedure manual that outlines how activities are scheduled
    * There is conflict on Wednesday night between the lessons and the ideas group
    * Club shows utilization and membership to win the political battle to keep the club going
    * The traditional culture is that there was bowling and a social component
    * Kris' vision is to have a diverse group of people bringing positive energy through activities and some people bowl
    * The priorities of the board is to get people out on the green bowling and increase membership through lessons
    * Most lawn bowling clubs usually suspend all non-lawn-bowling-related activities during the course of the season
    * The traditional lawn bowling club model may not keep the club sustainable in the long run -- the club may be better off trying to be more inclusive
    * The ideas group are the heaviest users of the club, and the only group that uses the club year round
* What does the ideas group want? 
    * The group traditionally meets at the same time and same place for such a long time that there is inertia to keep that the same
    * Kris would like to have some mixing between lawn bowlers and ideas group attendees
    * The plan right now is to go back to meet at 7 pm at the end of August
* There is some perception that the people who are paying $30 to use the clubhouse who are taking away time away from lawn bowling 
    * There seems to be a perception that only one group can use the clubhouse at a time
* Alternatives 
    * Have the ideas group rent the space for the year and take that proposal to the board
    * The board would like to accommodate all groups
    * Ideas group may be pushed out if it's moved to a model where they are charged for using the space -- the club would lose the revenue of those social members
    * The club members don't want to feel that they're being taken advantage of
* Can the ideas group participate in the upkeep in the club? 
    * Difficult to organize volunteers -- often takes more work to organize than to do the actual work
    * List of work that needs doing would be helpful
* Change process 
    * Some people may not be appeased no matter what we do
    * Maybe if everyone participates in the process then changes will go more smoothly
    * Calendaring system now works based on the priorities of the club (lawn bowling, new members) and other activities are a lower priority
    * It seemed that the social activities got squashed without notification by the new process
    * In the scheduling perhaps justify the slot of having ideas group using the time
    * Would help to know about all the events that are happening at the club
    * The board does not recognize that the ideas group is part of the schedule
* Going Forward 
    * Board needs to understand the value of utilization by the ideas group
    * Better communication about what different groups are doing
    * Participation by ideas members in club work as needs arise
    * Stronger ties with the club board can help to improve understanding
    * Perhaps more ideas group members participate as board members to have ideas group principles kept in awareness - would need 4 full members to join the board
    * If you come to ideas group more than a few times they need to join the lawn bowling club as a social member
    * Ideas group can write a [letter](http://archive.ideasmeetings.org/wiki/Letter "Letter") to the board or attend the board meeting to present the case of why they need to be valued
    * Propose a new activity type (that's not an event at $10/head) where the ideas group can fit in with a mix of member and non-member groups
    * What does the club propose to bring in new young members?
    * Shift the perception of the club to be one of community building, not just lawn bowling
    * When the lessons are over (on June 8), then the ideas group should be able to move to 7 pm (if in fact, the lessons are over) -- and the board meeting would be after the end of the lessons
* Other optional locations 
    * Union Club -- problem: no jeans
    * Bar -- too loud, people without disposable income would only drink water
* Ideas to Increase Club Participation/Utilization 
    * Social group to do some lawn bowling
    * Hack-a-thon at the ideas space
    * Try to push the priority of increasing membership and utilizing the club space as much as possible
    * Try to get some ideas group members on the board in the fall

### Island Cabin Hack-a-Thon

* Kris may be going to the Mayne Island hack-a-thon this weekend if anyone wants to go

### CIRA Board Members

* Kevin is running for CIRA
* Kris is thinking of running
* See [CIRA nominations](https://elections.cira.ca/2011/en/nom_com_nominees.html)
* Chance of getting on the board is lower, but over time we can get people on the board -- it's a long-term agenda
* Challenge is getting enough people to vote
* First people need to become CIRA members
* Need 200 people as CIRA members to vote for Kevin in September
* [How to become a CIRA member](https://member.cira.ca/en/member.html)
* Have a campaign to become a CIRA member - registration drive
* Need an info-graphic of CIRA registration steps
* Kevin could use some graphic designer support to promote his campaign
* [Kevin's campaign site](http://kevinforcira.ca/)
* People need to fill out form on Kevin's site so that he knows who his supporters are and how to contact them
