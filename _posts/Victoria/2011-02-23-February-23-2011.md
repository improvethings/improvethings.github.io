## Agenda

* Crowd-sourcing Kris' future round II
* [IdeaWave](http://www.ideawave.ca/)
* From roughly 8-9p.m. I've invited Christopher Bowers, who will be offering at no cost his [What's Gone Well Today](http://www.conversationworks.ca/whats-gone-well-today/) program with our group. I went through the session last night with the official advisory board and thought this would be a fun exercise for our group to try.
* Any updates on the DIY dryer?
* DIY clothing dresser; RFID door opener? motion activated door slides? How would the ideal dresser look and function? Perhaps larger with a bar with hanger for suits like an armoire?
* Update on [ASC](http://www.awesomeshitclub.com/)
* Canadians for an awesome internet
* We need an ideas meeting logo!
* I got a convenient travel laptop, help me come up with a clever hack to replace the lit logo on it
* Projector and screen for IdeaWave. 
    * NS just offered hers: [TDP S25 projector (Pdf)](http://www.toshiba.ca/web/pdf/TDP_S25.pdf) and a [InFocus SC-PD-80](http://www.frontierpc.com/SC-PD-80.html) screen. Issues to resolve: 
        * 3.3M is max projection distance and
        * The retractable screen has no brackets, so need a way to mount the 19.5lb screen
    * LM just scored one as well
    * Hotel to offer 6' screen at no cost
* Personal DB project - KC
